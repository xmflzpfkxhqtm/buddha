그때 부처님께서 사위국 기수급고독원에 계셨다.  
당시 여러 비구들이 가을 달 바람병이 일어나 몸이 메마르고 마르며, 또 악창이 생겼다.  
세존께서 한적한 곳에 계시며 생각하셨다.  
“이 여러 비구들이 지금 가을 달 바람병이 일어나 몸이 메마르고 또 악창이 생겼다. 내가 어떻게 하면 마땅히 하여 비구들이 여러 약을 복용할 수 있게 하여, 밥이나 마른 밥을 먹듯 약을 먹어 거칠게 나타나지 않게 할까?”  
또 이렇게 생각하셨다.  
“지금 다섯 가지 약이 있다. 세상 사람들이 아는 버터, 기름, 생버터, 꿀, 석밀이다. 비구들이 복용하도록 허락하겠다. 이 다섯 가지 약은 밥이나 마른 밥을 먹듯 먹어 거칠게 나타나지 않게 해야 한다.”  
그때 세존께서 정실에서 일어나 이 인연으로 비구 승가를 모아 말씀하셨다.  
“내가 정실에서 이렇게 생각했다. 지금 여러 비구들이 가을 달 바람병이 일어나 몸이 메마르고 또 악창이 생겼다. 내가 어떻게 하면 마땅히 하여 비구들이 여러 약을 복용할 수 있게 하여, 밥이나 마른 밥을 먹듯 약을 먹어 거칠게 나타나지 않게 할까? 내가 이렇게 생각했다. 지금 다섯 가지 약이 있다. 세상 사람들이 아는 버터, 기름, 생버터, 꿀, 석밀이다. 비구들이 복용하도록 허락한다. 밥이나 마른 밥을 먹듯 먹어 거칠게 나타나지 않게 해야 한다. 그러므로 다섯 가지 약을 복용하도록 허락한다. 만약 비구가 병이 있을 때는 마땅히 복용해야 한다.”  
그때 여러 비구들이 좋은 음식, 고기나 고기국을 얻었으나 제때 먹지 못하였다. 하물며 이 다섯 가지 약을 얻어 제때 먹을 수 있겠는가?  
약을 쌓아두었으나 병은 낫지 않고 몸은 메마르며 또 악창이 생겼다.  
그때 세존께서 알고 일부러 아난에게 물으셨다.  
“이 여러 비구들은 어찌하여 몸이 메마르고 또 악창이 생기는가?”  
아난이 부처님께 아뢰었다.  
“이 여러 병든 비구들은 좋은 음식, 고기와 고기국을 얻었으나 제때 먹지 못하니 하물며 이 다섯 가지 약을 제때 복용할 수 있겠습니까? 약을 많이 쌓아두었으나 병은 낫지 않습니다. 그래서 몸이 메마르고 또 악창이 생깁니다.”  
부처님께서 아난에게 말씀하셨다.  
“지금부터는 비구들이 병이 있을 때나 없을 때나 이 다섯 가지 약을 복용하도록 허락한다.”  
그때 병든 여러 비구들이 좋은 밥, 고기와 고기국을 얻었으나 제때 먹지 못하고 모두 간호하는 사람에게 주었다. 간호하는 사람이 충분히 먹으면 먹지 않고 버리니 까마귀들이 다투어 먹으며 울었다.  
그때 세존께서 알고 일부러 아난에게 물으셨다.  
“까마귀들이 어찌하여 울고 다투는가?”  
아난이 부처님께 아뢰었다.  
“병든 여러 비구들이 좋은 음식, 고기와 고기국을 얻었으나 제때 먹지 못하고 모두 간호하는 사람에게 주었다. 간호하는 사람이 충분히 먹으면 먹지 않고 버리니 까마귀들이 다투어 먹는 것입니다.”  
부처님께서 아난에게 말씀하셨다.  
“지금부터는 간호하는 사람이 남긴 음식을 먹도록 허락한다. 간호하는 사람이 충분히 먹었으면 부족한 음식을 스스로 먹도록 하라.”  
그때 여러 비구들이 아침에 소식을 받고 마을에 들어가 밥을 구해 충분히 먹고 승가람으로 돌아와 아침에 받은 음식을 먹으며 다른 비구들에게 나누어 주었다. 비구들이 충분히 먹고 남기면 먹지 않고 버리니 까마귀들이 다투어 먹으며 울었다.  
그때 세존께서 알고 일부러 아난에게 물으셨다.  
“까마귀들이 어찌하여 울고 다투는가?”  
아난이 위와 같은 인연을 모두 말하였다.  
“그래서 까마귀들이 울고 다투는 것입니다.”  
부처님께서 아난에게 말씀하셨다.  
“지금부터는 비구들이 아침에 소식을 받고 충분히 먹으면 남은 음식을 만들어 먹도록 하라. 남은 음식을 만드는 법은 ‘대덕이여, 나는 충분히 먹었으니 이것을 남은 음식으로 삼으라’고 말하며 탐심을 멈추고 남은 음식을 만들라.”  
또 남은 음식에 관한 다른 인연이 있으나 파위디 남은 음식법에서 말한 것과 다르지 않으므로 다시 번거롭게 기록하지 않는다.  

그때 존자 사리불이 바람병이 일어나 의사가 다섯 가지 지방 약을 복용하도록 가르쳤다.  
곰 지방, 곰 지방, 물고기 지방, 당나귀 지방, 돼지 지방, 마갈어 지방, 이 다섯 가지 지방을 복용하도록 허락하였다.  
복용할 때, 삶을 때, 거를 때는 기름 복용법과 같고, 때가 아닐 때는 받거나 삶거나 거르지 않는다.  
복용하는 자는 법에 따라 치료한다.  

그때 세존께서 사위국에서 사람들 사이를 다니시며 대비구 승가 1,250인과 함께 계셨다.  
당시 세곡이 귀하고 백성들이 기근에 시달려 구걸하기 어려웠다.  
오백 명의 거지가 세존을 따라다녔다.  
세존께서 한 나무 아래에 앉으셨다.  
그때 사비라비라라는 상인 코끼리 조련사 다섯 백 명이 수레를 타고 검은 석밀을 가지고 그 길로 오고 있었다.  
조련사들이 길 위에 부처님의 발자국이 천륜 바퀴처럼 빛나고 청정하며 아름답게 나타난 것을 보고, 발자국을 따라가 멀리서 세존께서 한 나무 아래에 앉아 계신 것을 보았다.  
용모가 단정하고 오관이 고요하며 최고의 조복을 얻어 자유자재하며 용과 코끼리처럼 맑은 연못처럼 내외가 청정함을 보고 기뻐하며 부처님 앞으로 가 머리로 땅을 예배하고 한쪽에 앉았다.  
세존께서 무수한 방편으로 조련사에게 미묘한 법을 설하여 기쁨을 일으키게 하셨다.  
조련사가 부처님의 법설을 듣고 기쁨을 일으키자 비구들에게 돌려 석밀 한 그릇을 공양하였다.  
비구들이 감히 받지 않고 “부처님께서 아직 들으시지 못하셨으니 비구들이 석밀을 받지 않는다”고 말하였다.  
이 인연으로 부처님께서 말씀하셨다.  
“지금부터 비구들이 석밀을 받도록 허락한다.”  
부처님께서 조련사에게 말씀하셨다.  
“조련사여, 단 한 그릇의 석밀을 비구들에게 주라.”  
조련사가 부처님의 가르침을 받고 단 한 그릇의 석밀을 비구들에게 주었다.  
남은 것이 있었으므로 부처님께서 조련사에게 다시 세 번 더 마음껏 만족할 만큼 주라고 말씀하셨다.  
조련사가 부처님의 가르침을 받고 다시 세 번 더 주었으므로 남은 것이 있었다.  
부처님께서 조련사에게 말씀하셨다.  
“이 남은 석밀을 깨끗한 땅에 두어 벌레가 없고 물속에 두어라. 왜냐하면 나는 천, 마왕, 범, 사문, 바라문, 세상 사람들이 이 남은 석밀을 먹고 소화하는 것을 보지 못했으나 오직 여래 한 사람만이 먹고 소화한다.”  
조련사가 이 남은 석밀을 깨끗한 땅에 두고 물속에 두었을 때, 물속에서 소리가 진동하고 연기와 불이 나며 마치 뜨거운 쇠붙이를 물속에 넣은 것과 같았다.  
남은 석밀을 물속에 쏟았을 때도 마찬가지였다.  
조련사가 이 변화를 보고 몸의 털이 곤두서며 두려워하여 부처님께 가 머리로 땅을 예배하고 한쪽에 앉아 이 인연을 상세히 아뢰었다.  
부처님께서 조련사의 두려움을 보고 미묘한 법을 설하시며 보시와 계율과 천상에 오르는 복덕을 말씀하시고, 더럽고 추한 것을 싫어하고 출리하는 것을 칭찬하시며 자리에서 모든 티끌과 때가 깨끗이 씻기고 법안목을 얻어 법을 깨닫고 과를 증득하였으며 부처님께 고하였다.  
“지금부터 부처님과 법과 승가에 귀의하오니 평생 동안 살생하지 않고 술도 마시지 않겠습니다.”  
조련사는 부처님의 법설을 듣고 기뻐하며 깨달음을 얻고 자리에서 일어나 부처님의 발을 예배하고 세 바퀴 돌고 떠났다.  

그때 여러 비구들이 마을에 들어가 구걸할 때 석밀을 잡다한 물건과 섞어 의심하여 제때 먹지 못하였다.  
부처님께서 비구들에게 말씀하셨다.  
“제때 먹지 않는 것은 법에 맞지 않다. 먹어도 된다.”  
석밀이 덜 된 것에 의심하는 비구에게 부처님께서 말씀하셨다.  
“먹어도 된다.”  
묽은 석밀에 의심하는 비구에게 부처님께서 말씀하셨다.  
“먹어도 된다.”  
흰 석밀에 의심하는 비구에게 부처님께서 말씀하셨다.  
“먹어도 된다.”  
잡물 섞인 석밀에 의심하는 비구에게 부처님께서 말씀하셨다.  
“먹어도 된다.”  
사탕수수 즙을 마시는 것에 의심하는 비구에게 부처님께서 말씀하셨다.  
“덜 익었으면 마셔도 되고, 익었으면 마시지 말라. 마시면 법에 따라 치료된다.”  
부처님께서 말씀하셨다.  
“제때 먹어도 된다.”  

그때 세존께서 마갈국 경계 사람들 사이를 다니시며 라열성에 이르셨다.  
비릉가파차가 이 성에 머물며 많은 지식과 제자들이 있어 부유하게 버터, 생버터, 꿀, 석밀을 제자들에게 주어 제자들이 편히 받았다.  
쌓아두어 큰 항아리를 가득 채우고, 주인이 술잔, 바구니, 대접, 작은 대접, 망사 주머니, 물주머니, 말뚝, 상아 갈고리, 창문 틈 등 곳곳에 걸어두어 넘치고 흘러 집안에 냄새가 나고 더러웠다.  
그때 장로들이 와서 이 쌓아둔 약들이 어지럽고 지저분한 것을 보고 비난하며 말했다.  
“사문과 석가의 제자들이 멈출 줄 모르고 많이 구하는구나. 밖에서 스스로 ‘나는 정법을 안다’고 말하면서 어찌 이리 약을 쌓아두는가? 왕의 항아리와 창고를 쌓아둔 것과 다르지 않다.”  
그때 여러 비구들이 듣고 그 중 적은 자들이 욕망이 적고 만족하며 수행하는 도반들이 이 여섯 무리 비구들을 꾸짖으며 말했다.  
“어찌 비릉가파차 제자들이 여러 약을 쌓아두고 곳곳에 걸어두어 넘치고 흘러 집안을 더럽히는가?”  
그 후 그들은 세존께 가 머리로 땅을 예배하고 한쪽에 앉아 이 인연을 상세히 아뢰었다.  
세존께서 이 인연으로 비구 승가를 모아 무수한 방편으로 여섯 무리 비구들과 비릉가파차 제자들을 꾸짖으며 말씀하셨다.  
“너희가 하는 일은 옳지 않고 바른 행실이 아니며 사문법도 아니고 청정한 행위도 아니며 순종하는 행위도 아니다. 마땅히 하지 말아야 할 일이다. 어찌하여 이렇게 여러 약을 쌓아두어 넘치고 흘러 왕의 항아리와 창고를 쌓아둔 것과 다르지 않게 하는가?”  
세존께서 무수한 방편으로 꾸짖으시고 말씀하셨다.  
“이 어리석은 자들은 여러 번의 잘못된 행위를 하여 처음으로 계를 어긴다. 지금부터 비구들과 계를 맺어 십구조의 뜻을 모으고 정법이 오래 머무르도록 하려 하니 계를 설할 때는 이렇게 말하라.  
만약 비구가 병이 있을 때 남은 약인 버터, 기름, 생버터, 꿀, 석밀을 일곱 날 동안 복용하도록 허락한다.  
일곱 날이 지나 복용하면 니사기파위디 비구의 뜻과 같다.  
병든 비구는 의사의 가르침에 따라 복용한다.  
약은 버터, 기름, 생버터, 꿀, 석밀이다.  
만약 비구가 하루에 약을 얻고 이틀, 삼일, 사일, 오일, 육일, 칠일 동안 약을 쌓아두면 여덟째 날에 명백한 증상이 나타나며 칠일 동안 얻은 약은 모두 니사기파위디가 된다.  
만약 비구가 하루에 약을 얻고 이틀 얻지 못하고 삼일 얻고 사일 얻고 이렇게 하여 칠일 동안 약을 얻어 여덟째 날에 명백한 증상이 나타나면 육일 동안 얻은 약은 모두 니사기파위디가 된다.  
만약 비구가 하루에 약을 얻고 이틀, 삼일 얻지 못하고 이렇게 점점 줄어들어 칠일 동안 얻지 못하면 여덟째 날에 명백한 증상이 나타나면 오일 동안 얻은 약은 모두 니사기파위디가 된다.  
이와 같이 여러 경우에 대해 계를 설한다.  
만약 비구가 약을 얻고 불결하게 시주하거나 깨끗하게 시주하거나 번갈아 시주하면 여덟째 날에 명백한 증상이 나타나면 육일 동안 얻은 약은 모두 니사기파위디가 된다.  
만약 비구가 약을 얻고 불결하게 시주하고 깨끗하게 시주하는 것을 번갈아 하면 칠일 동안 얻은 약은 모두 니사기파위디가 된다.  
만약 잃어버리거나 고의로 훼손하거나 약이 아닌 것을 만들거나 친지의 뜻을 받아들이거나 잊어버리거나 하면 모두 니사기파위디가 된다.  
만약 비구가 약을 버리지 않고 다시 거래하거나 남은 약을 한 니사기파위디나 한 투기라에게 주면 이는 니사기파위디가 된다.  
니사기파위디는 반드시 버리고 승가에 주어야 한다.  
만약 여러 사람이 있어도 한 사람이 별도로 주어서는 안 되고, 주지 못하면 투기라가 된다.  
만약 승가에 주려면 승가에 가서 오른쪽 어깨를 드러내고 가죽 신을 벗고 상좌를 향해 절하고 오른쪽 무릎을 땅에 대고 합장하여 이렇게 말해야 한다.  
‘대덕 승가여 들으소서. 나는 어느 비구가 남은 약을 일곱 날 이상 쌓아두어 니사기파위디를 범하였으니 지금 승가에 버립니다. 버린 뒤 참회하겠습니다.’  
참회할 사람이 앞에 있어 이렇게 말해야 한다.  
‘대덕 승가여 들으소서. 어느 비구가 남은 약을 일곱 날 이상 쌓아두어 니사기파위디를 범하였으니 지금 승가에 버립니다. 만약 승가가 도착하면 승가가 참회를 받아들이도록 허락해 주십시오.’  
말을 마치고 참회한다.  
참회하는 자가 그 사람에게 말한다.  
‘네 마음을 자책하라.’  
비구가 대답한다.  
‘예.’  
승가는 즉시 그 비구에게 약을 돌려준다.  
비구는 약을 받아 바르고 등불을 켜야 한다.  
승가에서 버리고 돌려주지 않으면 투기라가 된다.  
만약 누군가 ‘돌려주지 말라’고 가르치면 투기라가 된다.  
만약 깨끗한 시주로 바꾸거나 남은 약을 주거나 스스로 삼의나 다른 옷을 만들거나 여러 번 입으면 모두 투기라가 된다.  
비구니, 니사기파위디, 식차모나, 사미, 사미니도 투기라가 된다.  
이것을 범죄라 한다.  
범죄하지 않는 자는 일곱 날이 지나지 않은 약, 버터, 기름, 생버터, 꿀, 석밀을 간호하는 사람에게 주고, 일곱 날이 지나면 비구에게 돌려준다.  
비구는 약을 받아 바르고 등불을 켜야 하며 범죄하지 않는다.  
범죄하지 않는 자는 처음 계를 제정하지 않았거나 어리석고 미친 마음, 혼란과 괴로움에 시달리는 자이다.  
이상으로 스물여섯 번째 끝.  

그때 부처님께서 사위국 기수급고독원에 계셨다.  
비사라모 어머니가 부처님과 비구 승가를 청하여 다음 날 음식을 준비하였다.  
밤에 여러 가지 좋은 음식과 음료를 마련하고 아침 일찍 하녀를 보내 승가람에 가서 ‘시간이 되었다’고 알렸다.  
그때 하늘에서 큰 비가 내려 코끼리 오줌처럼 쏟아졌다.  
그때 세존께서 비구들에게 말씀하셨다.  
“너희는 오늘 모두 나가 비를 맞으며 목욕하라. 이것이 마지막 비다. 지금의 염부제의 비는 사천 대륙의 비와 같다.”  
그때 비구들이 부처님의 가르침을 듣고 각자 집을 나와 벌거벗은 몸으로 비를 맞으며 목욕하였다.  
하녀가 승가람 문 밖에 가서 멀리서 비구들이 모두 벌거벗고 목욕하는 것을 보고 이렇게 생각하였다.  
“사문이 없다. 모두 벌거벗은 외도이다.”  
하녀가 돌아가 비사라모 어머니에게 말했다.  
“모두가 벌거벗은 외도라 승가람에 사문이 없다.”  
비사라모 어머니는 총명하고 지혜로워 이렇게 생각하였다.  
“조금 전 하늘에서 비가 내려 비구들이 옷을 벗고 벌거벗은 몸으로 비를 맞으며 목욕하였으니 하녀가 몰라서 벌거벗은 외도라 한 것이다.”  
또 하녀에게 명하여 “빨리 승가람에 가서 큰 소리로 ‘시간이 되었다’고 알리라” 하였다.  
하녀가 승가람에 가서 큰 소리로 “시간이 되었다”고 알렸다.  
그때 세존께서 정실에서 나오시며 하녀에게 말씀하셨다.  
“너희도 가라. 내가 곧 가겠다.”  
세존께서 비구들에게 말씀하셨다.  
“옷을 입고 밥그릇을 들라. 지금 시간이 되었다.”  
비구들이 세존의 가르침을 받고 각자 옷과 밥그릇을 들었다.  
세존께서 대비구 승가 1,250인과 함께 힘센 장수가 팔을 구부렸다 폈다 하는 사이에 기수원 정사에서 갑자기 사라져 비사라모 어머니 집에 가서 자리에 앉으니 옷이 젖지 않았다.  
비구들도 모두 그러하였다.  
그때 하녀가 밤늦게 집에 도착하여 세존과 비구들이 이미 집에 와서 차례로 앉아 옷이 젖지 않은 것을 보고 이렇게 생각하였다.  
“세존은 매우 신기하고 특별하며 큰 신력이 있다. 내가 늦게 왔는데도 먼저 도착하였다.”  
그때 비사라모 어머니가 여러 가지 좋은 음식과 음료로 부처님과 비구 승가를 공양하였다.  
음식을 먹고 밥그릇을 내려놓고 낮은 자리로 와 앉아 부처님께 말씀드렸다.  
“부디 세존께서 저의 소원을 들어주시길 바랍니다.”  
부처님께서 비사라모 어머니께 말씀하셨다.  
“여래는 남의 소원을 넘어서 주지 않는다.”  
비사라모 어머니가 다시 부처님께 말씀드렸다.  
“대덕이시여, 만약 청정하다면 허락해 주십시오.”  
부처님께서 말씀하셨다.  
“뜻대로 하라.”  
비사라모 어머니가 부처님께 말씀드렸다.  
“먼 곳에서 온 여러 손님 비구들이 와서 갈 곳을 몰라서 부처님께 ‘어느 비구가 죽었는가? 어디에 사는가?’라고 묻는다면 부처님께서 허락해 주시길 바랍니다.”  
그때 세존께서 기록하여 말씀하셨다.
